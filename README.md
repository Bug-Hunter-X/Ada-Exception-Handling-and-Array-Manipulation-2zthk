# Ada Exception Handling and Array Manipulation

This example demonstrates a potential uncommon error in Ada related to exception handling within loops that manipulate arrays.  The code initializes an array, iterates through it, and modifies elements.  However, it doesn't handle potential exceptions explicitly.  The challenge lies in improving error handling and making the code more robust.
